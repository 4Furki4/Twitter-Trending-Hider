# Twitter Trending Hider

## The Story
I was reading one of the awesome CSS trick posts of [jhey](https://twitter.com/jh3yy) and it was as clear as mud to me. Besides, the trending section is live and changing as time passes which makes it too distracting. So, I decided to make an extension that allows one-click toggling of the trending section. I'm excited to share my very first browser extension and I hope you find it helpful!

## Features

- With just one click, you can hide or show the trending section on each Twitter tab.
- Your choice will remain saved even if you close or refresh the page. It is persistent.
